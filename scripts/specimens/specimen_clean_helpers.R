#  NOT the runnable stage. The orchestrator specimen_bee_clean.R calls them.)
#
# The testable, side-effect-free transforms behind specimen cleaning. The
# orchestrator (specimen_bee_clean.R) does the I/O (read the .xlsx, read the
# lookup/complex-map CSVs, run the review gate, write outputs) and calls these.
# Every function here is df-in / df-out (or a small decision), so the QC logic is
# unit-tested in tests/testthat/test-specimen.R.
#
# Depends on: dplyr, stringr, lubridate.
