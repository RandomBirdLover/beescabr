# beescabr pipeline -- STAGE 3: PUBLISHING MATERIALS (the public GitHub Pages site)
#
# The three pipeline stages, each its own runner:
#   1. run_data_cleaning_pipeline.R      ingest iNat -> DuckDB cache -> cleaned tables
#   2. run_all_analysis_pipeline.R       every figure + table + report/journal HTML
#   3. run_publishing_materials_pipeline.R   <-- THIS: build + publish the public site
#
# This stage re-renders ONLY the pages that go PUBLIC (field guides, park summary,
# least-sampled, the transect + bee-bounty maps, and the occurrence explorer), then
# copies them into docs/ and rebuilds the landing page (via scripts/website/). The
# publish modules live in scripts/website/, the way cleaning lives in scripts/clean/
# and analysis in scripts/analysis/.
#
#   source("scripts/run_publishing_materials_pipeline.R")                     # rebuild docs/ (then git push to deploy)
#   Sys.setenv(BEESCABR_DEPLOY = "1"); source("scripts/run_publishing_materials_pipeline.R")   # also commit + push docs/ (auto-deploy)
#
# Assumes the analysis data is current -- run stages 1 + 2 first.
