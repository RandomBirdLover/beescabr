# run_data_cleaning_pipeline.R
# beescabr pipeline -- ONE COMMAND: ingest + clean + export
# Created: 2026-07-13
#
# The single entrypoint that runs the whole pipeline end to end. Core data first,
# ALL checklist/taxonomy work LAST:
#   1.  INGEST   iNat API -> DuckDB cache (once, incremental)
#   2.  EXPORT   refresh data/inat_observations/cache/export_flat.rds (the brain's input)
#   2b. PLANTS   pull vascular plants -> SEPARATE plant cache -> export_flat_plant.rds
#                (the brain's second input; survey-day confirm + flower resources)
#   3.  BRAIN    finding_project_info(): survey membership from crosswalk_master ->
#                project_unclean + unknown tags/fields/notes -> master_per_survey_info_generated.csv
#   3b. REVIEW   walk unknown tags + fields (interactive) -> crosswalk_master ->
#                re-run brain. Then [3d] eyeball the survey-date windows with no tagged
#                survey nearby (heads-up only, no re-run) and [3e] rule any equal-split
#                transect ties. Skipped non-interactive.
#   4.  CLEAN    cabr_inat_bee_clean_generated.csv (labeled CABR bee table; walk-in re-marked not-survey)
#   5.  CHECKLIST STUFF (LAST): Holway reference -> taxonomy lookup -> the new
#                per-source checklists (parked until built)
#
# Ingest runs exactly once here; every stage reads the same freshly-filled cache
# (no re-fetch).
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO RUN (RStudio, most common first)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Normal run -- pull only NEW/edited observations since last time (fast, seconds):
#     source("scripts/run_data_cleaning_pipeline.R")            # no flags needed; this is the default
#
#   Everyday run -- reuse the caches, don't touch iNat at all:
#     Sys.setenv(BEESCABR_SKIP_INGEST = "1")
#     source("scripts/run_data_cleaning_pipeline.R")
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FLAGS = on/off switches. How they work (READ THIS -- it bit us once):
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   * A flag is just an env var stored in your R SESSION's memory.
#   * Turn a flag ON :  Sys.setenv(FLAG_NAME = "1")
#   * Turn a flag OFF:  Sys.unsetenv("FLAG_NAME")
#   * Check a flag   :  Sys.getenv("FLAG_NAME")   # ""  = off,  "1" = on
#   * A flag you set STAYS ON for the whole R session (every source() re-uses it)
#     until you Sys.unsetenv() it or restart RStudio. That is how a leftover
#     BEESCABR_FULL_INGEST=1 can silently make every run do a slow full rebuild.
#   * Terminal equivalent: prefix it, e.g.  Sys.setenv(BEESCABR_SKIP_INGEST = "1"); source("scripts/run_data_cleaning_pipeline.R")
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE FLAGS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   BEESCABR_SKIP_INGEST=1  -> don't call iNat at all; use whatever is already cached.
#                              Use when you just want to re-clean/re-export existing data.
#
#   BEESCABR_SKIP_PLANTS=1  -> RECOVERY HATCH, not a normal run mode. Pulls bees but
#                             leaves plant data stale, so survey-day confirmation and
#                             every forage/flower result use OLD plants. Use only when
#                             the plant pull is broken and you need the bee side now.
#                             Deliberately absent from the run menu; it warns loudly.
#                             A plant pull that ERRORS stops the run on purpose -- re-run
#                             first (most failures are transient); reach for this flag
#                             only if it keeps failing and you need the bee side now.
#
#   BEESCABR_FULL_INGEST=1  -> !! SLOW, RARELY NEEDED !! Wipe the ENTIRE cache and
#                              re-download every observation from scratch (~40+ min for
#                              bees + plants). You'll see "Full rebuild: cleared N cached
#                              observations; re-downloading everything." in the console --
#                              if you see that and didn't mean it, this flag is stuck ON:
#                              stop, run Sys.unsetenv("BEESCABR_FULL_INGEST"), re-run.
#                              Default (flag OFF) is INCREMENTAL: keeps the cache and only
#                              fetches records newer than the newest one you already have.
#                              Only turn ON if the cache looks wrong/corrupt or the iNat
#                              query params (place/taxon filters) changed.
#
#   BEESCABR_REBUILD_HOLWAY_REF=1  force-rebuild the Holway reference table (see NOTE below).
#   BEESCABR_NONINTERACTIVE=1      auto-skip ambiguous Holway names (no prompts).
#
#   BEESCABR_REFRESH=1      -> ONLINE. Force a full re-check of IUCN Red List status + plant
#                              common names against the live APIs (needs internet + an IUCN
#                              token), rewriting their caches, then the run re-bakes the fresh
#                              values into the cleaned tables. Default OFF: a normal run stays
#                              OFFLINE and keeps both current for NEW taxa incrementally -- turn
#                              this ON only to re-check taxa already cached (IUCN edits a few/yr).
#                              Runs the two reference/refresh_*.R tools as a pre-step.
#
# NOTE: step 1b builds the Holway reference table ONCE (resolving 700+ names to
# iNat taxa is slow + interactive). The result is saved to a versioned file and
# REUSED every run thereafter -- no re-resolution, no prompts. Rebuild only when
# Holway ships a new checklist version, via BEESCABR_REBUILD_HOLWAY_REF=1.
