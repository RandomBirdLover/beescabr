# analysis/coverage/records_near_transect.R
# beescabr -- every bee record in the park, by the transect it was recorded NEAR.
#
# NOT the same figure as transect_effort.R, and not a replacement for it.
#   transect_effort.R  counts SURVEY records, by the transect the surveyor tagged.
#                      That is sampling effort: somebody walked that transect.
#   this               counts EVERY record, by the transect it is physically closest
#                      to. That is spatial coverage: where in the park bees get
#                      recorded, by anyone, including the public.
#
# The two do not add up and are not meant to. 4,106 records carry no transect tag --
# almost all of them public observations rather than project surveys -- and the effort
# figure drops them, correctly. This one places them by location instead.
#
# The buffer is the whole figure: a record more than BUFFER_M from every route is left
# out rather than pushed to the nearest one. At 10 m the routes barely overlap, so
# almost nothing is ambiguous; widen it and the OT/TP junction starts claiming records
# that could belong to either.

#' Which route is a record near, if any?
#'
#' PURE, taking a distance matrix so the rule is testable with no spatial data.
#' Nearest-within-the-buffer wins; a record equidistant from two routes is left
#' unassigned rather than picked arbitrarily, because there is no fact to pick on.
#'
#' @param dmat Rows = records, columns = routes (named), values = metres.
#' @param buffer_m How close counts as near.
#' @param tie_breaker Which route wins when two are exactly equidistant. TP, because
#'   the ties happen at the OT/TP junction and TP is the route actually walked there --
#'   it is surveyed as two transects and carries roughly double the effort of any other.
#'   Named rather than implicit: a tie-break is a decision, and a silent one is the kind
#'   of thing nobody finds for years.
#' @return A list of `route` (character, NA when out of range, or tied with the
#'   tie-breaker not among the tied) and `ambiguous` (TRUE when more than one route
#'   was within the buffer).
