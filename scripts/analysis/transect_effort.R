# analysis/transect_effort.R
# Per-transect sampling effort  (companion to rarefaction_{vegan,inext}.R)
# beescabr / Cabrillo National Monument (CABR) native bees
#
# WHAT THIS IS:
#   Sampling-effort bar charts by transect -- how many bee records each transect
#   has produced, split by method (lethal netting vs non-lethal photos) and as a
#   plain total. Specimen coordinates are transect centroids, so effort is
#   summarised BY TRANSECT (their reliable spatial unit): all-records for the
#   report, the fair survey window for the journal.
#
#   (A fine iNaturalist grid / whole-park spatial richness map lived here before;
#   it was retired -- the basemap-less, UTM-axis cell maps were unreadable, and the
#   effort-standardized richness story is told by rarefaction_{vegan,inext}.R by
#   transect. The dead grid + map code was removed rather than left commented.)
#
# Run from the repo root:  Rscript scripts/analysis/transect_effort.R
# Depends on: dplyr, stringr, ggplot2 (+ config.R).
