# =============================================================
# config.R
# beescabr pipeline -- central configuration
# Created: 2026-07-13 (API + DuckDB rewrite)
#
# Single source of truth for the constants that used to be scattered
# across native_bee_checklist.R, inat_bee_clean.R, spatial_utils.R and
# the old Python pipeline (place_id, taxon ids, CRS, the iNat user-agent,
# the DuckDB cache path, and the observation-field id map).
#
# Source this near the top of any script in the pipeline:
#   source("scripts/config.R")
# =============================================================

# ---- iNaturalist API ---------------------------------------------------------
# ---- EXTERNAL API VERSIONS (single source of truth; quote these in any write-up) ----
# iNaturalist: REST API v1. Everything the pipeline pulls -- observations, taxa,
#   observation fields -- goes through https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/. iNat also has a
#   newer v2, which we do NOT use; a move to v2 would change response shapes and must be
#   a deliberate migration (see dev-docs/TODO.md).
# IUCN Red List: API v4, reached through the rredlist R package rather than raw HTTP.
#   Requires a free token (data/secrets/iucn_api.env or IUCN_REDLIST_KEY). Recorded in
#   the source column of data/checklists/iucn/iucn_status_generated.csv on every fetch, so each
#   cached status carries the API version it came from.
# ---- Packages the pipeline needs ---------------------------------------------
# THE LIST lives here because config.R is the constants file; INSTALLING lives in
# scripts/utils/install_requirements.R because config.R is sourced by every script and
# must not touch the network at load. Run the installer once on a new machine:
#     source("scripts/utils/install_requirements.R")
# The per-script auto-install blocks stay as a safety net; they should rarely fire.
BEESCABR_PACKAGES <- c(

# beescabr_require(): the per-script dependency guard. CHECKS, never installs.
#
# Every script used to carry its own for(pkg in ...) install.packages() block. That
# duplicated the list (those blocks covered 14 packages while the real set is 36, so they
# had already drifted), and it meant running one script could silently install software.
# Now a script calls beescabr_require() and, if anything is missing, stops with the single
# command that fixes it. Installing is install_requirements.R's job alone.
#
# Defaults to the WHOLE list rather than a per-script subset: a subset is another list to
# keep in sync, and that is exactly the drift this replaced.
# have_fn / stop_fn are injectable so the failure path is testable.

# Pause between API calls (seconds). iNat's hard limit is ~100 requests/min
# and they ask you to keep well under it; with ~0.3-0.5s of network time per
# request, a 0.5s pause lands around ~70-80 req/min -- fast but courteous.
# iNaturalist's published limits (v2 API docs): 100 requests/minute is the hard cap, they
# ASK for 60/minute or lower, and under 10,000/day, warning that they "may institute blocks
# without notification". 1 second between calls puts us at 60/minute, the rate they ask for.
# It was 0.5 (120/minute), over even the hard cap. Do not lower it: a block would cost the
# whole season's ingest, and the pull is not time-critical.
# The transport still backs off exponentially on 429/5xx.
INAT_THROTTLE_SEC <- 1.0

# ---- Taxa / place ------------------------------------------------------------
# Anthophila (all bees). Root taxon for every observation query.
TAXON_ANTHOPHILA <- 630955L
# Apis mellifera (Western honey bee) -- excluded via without_taxon_id so the
# checklist stays native-only. (This is the 47219 seen in the Python query.)
TAXON_APIS_MELLIFERA <- 47219L
# iNat place_id for the "San Diego County 25 Mile Buffer" custom place that
# the retired CSV export was scoped to. Same id used in the Python pipeline.
PLACE_SD_COUNTY_BUFFER <- 118491L

# ---- PLANT ingest: taxon / place ---------------------------------------------
# Vascular plants (Tracheophyta) -- the ROOT taxon for the plant pull. Chosen
# over Angiospermae because gymnosperms AND angiosperms both bear pollen (the bee
# forage we care about); the few ferns/lycophytes that ride along are harmless and
# get dropped by the flowering/pollen filter downstream. Same philosophy as the
# bee ingest: pull broad at the root, narrow in the clean/analysis layer.
# Sanity-check the id on the first run (the ingest prints it): api taxa/211194.
TAXON_TRACHEOPHYTA <- 211194L
# iNat place for the plant pull. Point Loma Peninsula (132551) FULLY CONTAINS the
# cabr_survey_box (which is hand-drawn to extend past the NPS monument outline),
# so it won't clip edge survey spots; the brain re-filters to the exact box by
# point-in-polygon, discarding the rest. Cabrillo National Monument alone
# (place 4715) is tighter/smaller but risks clipping the box -- kept for reference.
PLACE_POINT_LOMA    <- 132551L
PLACE_CABR_MONUMENT <- 4715L

# ---- Analysis scope: the FAIR WINDOW (journal method-comparison) --------------
# The pipeline feeds TWO papers with different scopes:
#   * JOURNAL paper (lethal vs non-lethal method comparison) -- must compare the two
#     methods on equal footing, so every method-comparison figure restricts to the
#     FAIR WINDOW: survey records only (is_survey), FAIR_MONTHS, FAIR_YEARS, and
#     attributed only (blank/casual surveyor_type dropped). This keeps "non-lethal"
#     to beeple survey photos -- no casual public, no interns' 2024 iNaturalist photos.
#   * NPS CABRILLO REPORT (what bees the park holds) -- wants ALL records, casual
#     public included, so report figures do NOT apply this window.
# Defined ONCE here so the window can't drift across scripts (it did before this).
FAIR_MONTHS <- 3:10          # Mar-Oct: the standardized survey protocol season (interns netted Mar through Oct)
FAIR_YEARS  <- 2021:2023     # the only years the lethal-netting surveys ran (so non-lethal gets no extra years)

# ---- Paper output roots ------------------------------------------------------
# Each analysis script writes its figures + tables STRAIGHT into the paper folder it
# belongs to (no neutral theme folder, no separate collector step). A concept sub-path
# is kept under each root (e.g. .../richness/rarefaction/by_transect) so files stay
# organised and never collide.
#   * REPORT  (all records)  -- the NPS Cabrillo park report.
#   * JOURNAL (fair window)  -- the lethal-vs-non-lethal method paper.
# SPLIT scripts (same concept, two datasets) write their all-records version under
# DIR_REPORT and their fair-window version under DIR_JOURNAL.
# SEASON YEAR. Each season's deliverables live in their own folder so last year's
# outputs stay frozen as the record of what was actually reported. This follows the
# calendar year automatically -- a new season needs NO code edit. To rebuild an older
# season (or to keep working in 2026 after the new year rolls over), set
# BEESCABR_SEASON_YEAR=2026 before running.
beescabr_season_year <- function(override = Sys.getenv("BEESCABR_SEASON_YEAR", ""),

  y <- suppressWarnings(as.integer(override))
  if (!is.na(y) && y > 1900L && y < 2200L) return(y)
  as.integer(format(today, "%Y"))
}
# ONE folder per season. The report and the paper are two framings of the same
# year's data, not two analyses -- 11 scripts write to both -- so they share a tree.
# Journal figures are told apart by "_journal" in the filename, never by folder.
beescabr_analysis_dir <- function(year = beescabr_season_year()) sprintf("data/analysis/%d_generated", year)

# ---- DuckDB cache ------------------------------------------------------------
# One on-disk DuckDB file acts as the cache for BOTH observation objects
# (with a spatial geometry column) and taxon request objects. This replaces
# the retired CSV export entirely and the Python taxon_cache.json.
DB_CACHE_PATH <- "data/inat_observations/cache/inat_cache.duckdb"

# Cached flattened export frame (RDS). Flattening ~77k observations from JSON
# and resolving their taxonomy is slow, so read_observations_export() memoizes
# the result here and only rebuilds when the observation/taxon cache content
# changes (a content fingerprint decides). Delete this file or set
# BEESCABR_REFRESH_FLAT=1 to force a rebuild.
EXPORT_FLAT_CACHE <- "data/inat_observations/cache/export_flat.rds"

# Records when observations were last ingested, so a refresh can also re-pull
# observations that were re-identified/edited on iNaturalist since then
# (updated_since), not just brand-new ones.
INGEST_STATE_PATH <- "data/inat_observations/cache/last_ingest.txt"

# ---- PLANT cache (kept SEPARATE from the bee cache) ---------------------------
# The plant ingest uses its OWN DuckDB file, export RDS, and updated_since state,
# so its incremental id-cursor never collides with the bee cache and a plant pull
# never invalidates the (expensive) 77k-bee export fingerprint. Identical schema
# and code path -- just a different connection + paths (see ingest_plants.R).

EXPORT_FLAT_PLANT_CACHE <- "data/inat_observations/cache/export_flat_plant.rds"
INGEST_STATE_PATH_PLANT <- "data/inat_observations/cache/last_ingest_plant.txt"

# ---- Observation-field id map ------------------------------------------------
# The flatten step builds `field:<lower(name)>` columns generically from the
# API `ofvs` array (guaranteeing name-parity with the old CSV export). This
# map is the STABLE-ID reference for the handful of fields the pipeline treats
# specially -- names can be edited on iNat, ids cannot. Use these when logic
# must not break on a display-name change.
