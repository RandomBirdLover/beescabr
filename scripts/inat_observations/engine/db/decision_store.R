# beescabr pipeline -- persisted manual disambiguation decisions (DuckDB)
# Created: 2026-07-13 (API + DuckDB rewrite)
#
# The Holway reference builder is interactive: when an iNat name search is
# ambiguous, a human picks the right taxon (or skips). Those decisions are
# recorded here keyed by the exact search term, so re-running the builder
# is reproducible and never re-prompts for an already-decided term. This is
# what makes "manual intervention" safe to bake into a batch pipeline.
#
# Depends on: DBI, duckdb.

# Return the recorded decision for a search term, or NULL if undecided.
# A decision is list(action, chosen_taxon_id). action is one of:
#   "pick"      -> resolved to chosen_taxon_id
#   "keep"      -> valid in ITIS but not on iNat (blank id, itis_valid TRUE)
#   "skip"      -> checked ITIS, not valid / unpublished (blank id, itis_valid FALSE)
#   "tentative" -> two-word name the user said is NOT a subspecies; provisional
#                  (blank id, itis_valid blank)

#' checklist.
#'
#' The distinction is about the QUESTION, not the bee. Every checklist row asks about a
#' full name -- "Andrena vandykei" -- and these answers are filed under a bare genus
#' with no species after it. Nothing asks that, so nothing reads them. Naming them
#' outright beats any phrase the reader has to decode.
#'
#' @param names The search terms dropped.
#' @return One line, or two when there are more names than fit.

#' building the reference table with and without them produces byte-identical output.
