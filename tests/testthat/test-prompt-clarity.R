# Taro's feedback on the cleaning prompts, verbatim: "what is this asking me to

# validate it in ITIS if it has a taxa name change."
#
# Every one of those is answerable, and the answers were in dev-docs. But the
# person hitting these is at a terminal at 9pm, not reading dev-docs. A prompt
# that needs a second document open is a broken prompt.
#
# So each one must carry, in the terminal, at the moment it asks:
#   * a link to click,
#   * what the answer keys mean,
#   * what the question is actually deciding.
