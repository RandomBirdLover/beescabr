# A SEPARATE figure from survey effort, answering a different question: where in the
# park do bee records come from, regardless of who made them. The effort figure counts
# survey walks; this one counts records near a route. They are not comparable, and the
# labels have to keep them apart -- a bar called "TP" holding visitor photographs would
# read as TP survey data, which is the confusion this whole thread started with.
#
# Pure: it takes a distance matrix, so the rule is testable without any spatial data.
