# Analysis

Every analysis, what it produces, and where it lands.

Two things the picture cannot show:

- **`richness/rarefaction/` holds the observer comparison**, not `method_comparison/`.
  It is filed by what the analysis *is*, not by what it compares.
- **A `fair_*` subfolder means the output is restricted to one window.** Anything
  outside one is all-records.


## Where to find a figure or a table

Everything lands under `data/analysis/<year>_generated/`. One folder per question:

| Folder | Answers | png | csv |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coverage/bee_bounties` | which bees need which method next | 2 | 3 |
| `coverage/checklist_gaps` | CABR taxa not on the Holway county list | 1 | 3 |
| `coverage/footprint` | the park's share of county diversity | 1 | 3 |
| `coverage/id_resolution` | what needs identifying most | 1 | 2 |
| `coverage/least_sampled` | the go-find-it sheet | — | 2 |
| `coverage/off_transect` | bees in the park but off the transects | 1 | 3 |
| `coverage/records_by_evidence` | what backs each genus and species | 3 | 5 |
| `coverage/transect_effort` | per-transect sampling effort | 2 | 2 |
| `richness/accumulation` | have we found them all? (Chao2) | 3 | 2 |
| `richness/diversity` | Shannon / Simpson / NMDS | 4 | 3 |
| `richness/rarefaction` | richness at equal effort — by method, and by observer | 2 | 6 |
| `interactions/networks` | the plant–bee web, H2′ and NODF | 6 | 10 |
| `interactions/top_plants` | the plants bees visit most | 2 | 3 |
| `phenology/` | activity through the year, survey effort by month | 6 | 10 |
| `method_comparison/yield` | what each **method** turned up, and each **contributor** | 2 | 6 |
| `method_comparison/efficiency` | rarefied to equal effort | — | 1 |
| `method_comparison/effort` | survey trips by method | — | 1 |
| `reference/field_guide` | the species and genus guides | — | 4 |
| `reference/nps_summary` | plain counts, no interpretation | — | 11 |
| `reference/conservation` | IUCN status | 5 | 3 |
| `reference/occurrence_map`, `bee_plant`, `transects` | the interactive pages | 1 | — |

**Start at `findings_index.csv`** in that folder: one row per analysis, with its
type, its key finding in a sentence, and the file holding the numbers. Each folder
also has its own `WHAT_THESE_FILES_ARE.txt`.

**Two comparisons run here, and they are not the same question.** *Method* is lethal
vs non-lethal; *observer* is beeple vs interns. They were confounded before 2024 —
only interns netted, only beeple photographed — so each has its own window below, and the
observer results live under `richness/rarefaction/fair_observer_2024/` rather than in
`method_comparison/`. Read them together: lethal beats non-lethal, but with method
held constant beeple beat interns, so the gap is the netting rather than the people.

Anything under a `website/` subfolder is a draft page; publishing copies it to
`docs/`. Anything under `fair_method_2021_2023/` or `fair_observer_2024/` is
restricted to one of the windows below.

## The three fair windows

| Window | Compares | Controls for | Confounded with |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fair_method_2021_2023` (Mar–Oct) | lethal vs non-lethal | year | **observer** — only interns netted, only beeple photographed |
| `fair_observer_2024` (May–Sep) | beeple vs interns | method, year | *nothing — this is the clean one* |
| *(not built)* interns 2021–23 vs 2024 | lethal vs non-lethal | observer | year |

Read the first two together. Neither means much alone.

## Global conventions

These hold everywhere unless the table below overrides them.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Both ranks, always** | Every diversity / accumulation / interaction result runs at genus *and* species |
| **Scope is stated on every figure** | Never mixed silently. `scope_cap()` prints it. |
| **Method routing** | lethal = specimen table · non-lethal = iNaturalist |
| **Say lethal / non-lethal** | That is how the data is coded (`survey_method`) and how figures are labelled (`BEE_METHOD_LABEL`). Gloss it as "(net)" and "(photo)" on first use in a document, then stay with the coded terms. Do not switch to "specimen vs photo" or "nets vs photos" mid-way — a reader cannot tell whether a new pair of words means a new comparison. |
| **Season window** | Year-to-year comparisons clipped to `WINDOW_MONTHS` |
| **Transects** | BST, UPMON, TP, OT. TP is not oversampled — it is walked in both directions. |
| **Specimen coordinates are transect centroids** | ~980 specimens fall on ~18 points, so a specimen map is misleading |
| **Off-transect specimens are not surveys** | 115 of 980. They count toward park totals, but are excluded from per-survey effort. |
| **Show every genus** | No arbitrary top-N in genus figures |
| **On-transect means within 50 m** | `IBC_OFF_TRANSECT_M`. Casual iNaturalist coordinates drift to hundreds of metres, so a tighter buffer would drop real survey records. 7,440 of 11,396 records resolve to a transect. |
